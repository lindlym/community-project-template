# Community Project (Groups of 5)
The second to last project here in the Array Bootcamp! Congratulations on reaching this far. In this project you'll be working on a group project in teams of 5, with the goal of providing something unique to the community of Cheyenne, WY! You are assigned a company in Cheyenne to work with, and you'll be working on creating a website with features they want to have provided on it. In this project, leadership from Array will act as the "client" in weekly client meetings that you have to attend as a group to gather information on the project and provide updates/statuses on the project. 

### Technologies Required

- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- JavaScript, ES6
- NodeJS, ExpressJS, Mongoose
- MongoDB

## Project Requirements

Your general project requirements are going to come from your client meetings with the leadership teams. We're going to tell you the features we want, and then your team's tech leader will decide the feasibility of "additional" things we want besides the true requirements of the project. Good luck to everyone!

There are no bonus taskes for this assignment. Honor requirements will be automatically rewarded to the group if their project receives good review during the presentations as well as the code passes a 90/100 standard when grading!
